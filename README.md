👋 Hi, I'm currently pursuing my Master of Management in Analytics (MMA) at McGill University, where I’m learning how to bridge the gap between data science, business strategy, and real-world decision-making.  

📦 I come from a background in Supply Chain Management, which sparked my initial interest in how data can be used to streamline operations, improve forecasting accuracy, and enhance end-to-end visibility across global networks.  

📊 As part of my transition into the analytics and tech space, I'm continuously building hands-on experience with tools and languages such as Python, SQL, Power BI, and machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, etc.). I enjoy turning raw data into structured insights that help drive measurable business outcomes.  

🧠 I’m particularly interested in areas such as demand forecasting, customer segmentation, pricing analytics, and the use of data to support sustainability and supply chain resilience.  

🔍 My goal is to develop intelligent, data-driven systems that support better business decisions — whether that’s through predictive modelling, automation, or interactive dashboards.

📁 On this GitHub profile, you’ll find a collection of projects that reflect my journey, including:
- Exploratory data analysis on customer behaviour
- Time series forecasting and regression modelling
- Dashboard development using Power BI and Streamlit
- Data pipeline design and cloud integration (Snowflake, AWS)

🌱 I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and take on challenges that sit at the intersection of analytics, operations, and technology.
